# Braille-Translator

I like learning about langauges and how we represent them. This app is very much a learning tool for me and is not a fully functional polished translator but may be helpful in explaining how Braille works to you. I have made other projects where I created various diffrent language input methods (IME). These are all in my Github area so do take a look. I had learnt a bit of Sign language and next I was interested in how Braille works. This started as what I thought would be a small project but has shown me how complex Braille can be. I did find out that there are many varieties of Braille. The one I looked at is "Unified English Braille" which is controlled by "International Council on English Braille" and they have a website @ http://www.iceb.org/ueb.html 

On the site there is a document with all the rules @ http://www.iceb.org/Rules%20of%20Unified%20English%20Braille%202013.pdf. I have not included the full set of rules in my app so feel free to add them if you want. Most of my work has been to add some tables where I can take the character and convert it to it Unicode Braille character and display this. 

Not all fonts have the Braille pages which is Unicode page 28. If you see blocks in the App then your font does not have the required Glyphs and you will need to change the font in the app.

The translator is only at the stage of doing simple translations and makes the App look like a Kindergarten one rather than University style. It is mostly readable and understandable but can be made better when you include more of the rules in it.

It does not do any Contractions yet.

Once you have translated the text you can save it to disk via PDF.
